### Description of the project:
This application allows the user to organize aspects of their business by viewing details about the departments, roles, and employees. 

Upon running the start command, the user will be presented with a series of prompts. When selecting "View all Departments", "View all Employees", or "View all roles", a table will print to the console displaying relevant details of the items in that category. 

When selecting "Add a Department", "Add a Role", or "Add an Employee", the result is a new item for that category that is then added and subsequently can be displayed in a table.

Finally, if a user selects "Update an employee" they will be able to change data for a previously created employee. 
### Installation:
In order to install the necessary dependencies, open the console and run the following:
```npm init --y, npm i, npm i inquirer, npm i mysql2```
### Usage Instructions:
Copy and paste the SSH key from the code, paste in terminal in the desired directory, type in the terminal "git clone origin main", and install all the dependencies mentioned above. Type node index.js to start.
